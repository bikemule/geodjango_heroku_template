# GeoDjango Heroku template
A starting point for GeoDjango apps on Heroku, set up according to best practices. Most guides for GeoDjango on Heroku were out of date or incomplete, so I created this to help others who were similarly lost.

Includes:
* dj-database-url for auto-config of databases
* whitenoise for serving static files
* gunicorn for running on Heroku
